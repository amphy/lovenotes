# Love Notes

Have you ever wanted to share a message with your friend and have them see you type it in real time? Love Notes lets users link others to messages they type. It shows the exact typing speed of the message as well as any backspacing that occurs. Love Notes is great for creating sentimental messages to share with loved ones who will appreciate the thought behind your message that is now visible for them to see.
